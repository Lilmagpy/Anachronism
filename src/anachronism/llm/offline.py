"""The offline interpreter: rules on the player's words using only the curated library.

Used when there is no API key, when the player chooses offline play, and as the fallback
when a model call fails. It splits the message into parts, matches each part to library
advancements by their names and keywords, and rules from the engine's own feasibility
check. Anything it cannot match is "implausible" with a hint toward ideas within reach, so
offline play still feels like a court that listens (brief §10).
