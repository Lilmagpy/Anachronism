"""The court's counsel: each adviser recommends one idea a turn (DESIGN §14, brief §10).

The offline "Historical Advisors" way to play: instead of (or as well as) whispering ideas,
the player hears the steward, the general, the scholar and the diviner each recommend one
advancement within reach, chosen for what worries them now - thin granaries, an enemy at
the gates, restless streets. The choice is deterministic: it reads the game state only.
