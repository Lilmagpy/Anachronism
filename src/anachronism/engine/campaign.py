"""Chronicle mode (D-120): playing along history, chapter by chapter.

At the start and after every turn the next chapter whose year has come is opened, if its
conditions hold; chapters whose moment has passed without them (``until_year``) are passed
over, and the chronicle says how history turned. One chapter waits at a time; the player
answers it with a ``ChooseChapter`` action (a recorded action, so replays stay exact). A
chapter still waiting when the turn ends is settled the way history went. The almanac tells
what happened elsewhere in the world each year.

Everything else in the game goes on between chapters: ideas ahead of their time, buildings,
armies, diplomacy. Ideas the player has brought in can unlock choices history never had.
