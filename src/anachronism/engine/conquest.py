"""Taking a province (D-273): a garrison behind the walls, to be stormed or starved out.

Every province's owner keeps a garrison in its city: a share of its people under arms, more
behind built walls, twice as many in a capital. An army alone in an enemy province lays siege:
each turn its engines and numbers batter the walls, the garrison goes hungry, and the
besiegers sicken in their lines. Then it takes the city one of three ways (``Army.assault``):

- ``breach`` (the usual): storm the city once the walls are down;
- ``now``: storm at once, against walls still standing (far bloodier);
- ``starve``: never storm; wait until hunger and desertion leave no garrison, and the city
  opens its gates.

A storm is a battle (the same three phases, plans, formations and wings as in the field)
against the garrison, which fights from walls and streets with extra power. Beaten, the
besiegers fall back and the walls are rebuilt; victorious, they sack the city.

A city taken pays: spoils from the loser's treasury (twice as much, and some of its people,
when stormed and sacked), prestige at court (three times for a capital), veterancy and
morale for the army. Its new garrison starts small and is rebuilt over the turns of peace.
