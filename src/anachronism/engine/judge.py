"""Applying a ruling on the player's idea, after bounding everything in it (D-020).

Whatever produced the ruling (a model, the offline interpreter, a cached answer), this is
the last word: new advancements get complexity and year floors from their prerequisites,
effects are cut to the era's caps and the effect limit, unknown references are dropped, and
the advisers' nudges to unrest and suspicion are capped. Costs are never read from a
ruling: the engine derives them from complexity and year like any other advancement.
