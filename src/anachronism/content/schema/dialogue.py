"""Characters who speak during play, and what they say (step 2.12, D-059).

Lines are written for *moments* (an idea adopted, a riot, the game starting...). The client
shows a character's portrait with a line chosen from the moment's list. Placeholders in
braces are filled in by the game: ``{civ}``, ``{ruler}``, ``{subject}`` (the idea, place or
resource the moment is about), ``{year}``, ``{adjective}`` (Mongol, Roman), and for rivals
``{rival}``, ``{rival_ruler}`` and ``{rival_adjective}``. Prefer "the {adjective} realm" to
"{civ}" before a verb: names like "Mongols" are plural.
In Phase 3 the same characters speak freely through the language model.
