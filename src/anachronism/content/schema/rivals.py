"""Rival civilisations' intentions, temperaments and relations (brief §7, DESIGN §10).

A script is a conditional intention, not a dated event: "Qin wants Shu" fires when Qin is
stable, strong enough and Shu is weak, whatever the calendar says. Scripts can depend on
other scripts, so when the player knocks one off course the ones built on it fall too.
They are written per civilisation inside a scenario (``ScenarioCiv.scripts``).
